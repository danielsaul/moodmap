MoodMap is an online application which correlates data from Twitter with data 
from the government. Tweets are put through sentiment analysis (to assess the 
overall mood) and then plotted on a map according to the location from which 
they were tweeted from. Goverment data for deprivation is then overlayed on 
top of this.
